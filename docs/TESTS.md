# Tests

Choose your current OS:

* [Windows](##windows)
* [macOS](##macos)
* [Linux](##linux)

# Running the Tests

## Windows

1. Open a Command Prompt.

2. Get the first exercise:

    ```batchfile
     C:\Users\USERNAME> exercism download --exercise hello-world --track cobol
    ```

3. Change directory into the exercise folder:

    ```batchfile
     C:\Users\USERNAME> cd C:\Users\USERNAME\exercism\cobol\hello-world
    ```
   
4. Run the tests:

    ```batchfile
     C:\Users\USERNAME\exercism\cobol\hello-world> test.ps1
    ```
    *(Don't worry if the tests fail when you first run them, this is how you begin each exercise.)*

5. Solve the exercise. 
    Read through the `instructions.md` and see how to solve the exercise ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/exercism/cobol/blob/main/exercises/practice/hello-world/.docs/instructions.md)).


Good luck, have fun and welcome to the COBOL track!
