# Installation

Unlike newer languages, COBOL has multiple well-maintained compilers, though each has their own benefits. 

## GnuCobol

GnuCOBOL is the Free Software Foundation's Free and Open Source COBOL Compiler. It transpiles COBOL into a C program before using Gcc to compile that into an executable. Instructions for installation can be found [here][GnuCOBOL].

## IBM Cobol

As a mainframe vendor, IBM maintains its own dialect of COBOL that works on its z/OS as well as other modern operating systems. IBM COBOL can be obtained free of charge through applying for the [COBOL environment for VSCode][IBM COBOL], which is part of the [Open Mainframe Project][Open Mainframe].

I was considering adding Micro Focus's Visual COBOL, but because I don't know the terms of the license I'm not comfortable adding it here.
